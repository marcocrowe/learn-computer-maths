**You must answer Question One**  

## Question 1 (Total 40 marks)

### Question 1(a) **(4 marks)**

Evaluate for x = 4 and y = 5;  
$$5xy^2 - 2x^2y - 3(xy)^2 + 4y^3$$

### Question 1(b) **(6 marks)**

Evaluate, giving your answer correct to **two significant figures**:  
$$13.1^2 + (8.91 \times 10^4) - \sqrt{ 42^{2.5}} + 5^{-1.5}$$  

### Question 1(c) **(Total 8 marks)**

Simplify the following:

1. $5x^2 \cdot 3xy^2 \cdot 4x^2y^2$ **(4 marks)**
2. $\dfrac{27x^5 y^2}{(3xy^2)^2}$ **(4 marks)**

### Question 1(d) **(8 marks)**

Transpose the following to make z the subject:

$$x = \sqrt{\dfrac{5 + r}{2z + y}}$$

### Question 1(e) **(6 marks)**

Convert $1\ 1101.011_2$ to decimal.

### Question 1(f) **(8 marks)**

Prove, using truth tables:

$$\neg (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \land \neg q$$  
$$\overline{(p + q)} \equiv \overline{p} \cdot \overline{q}$$

## Question 2 (Total 30 marks)

### Question 2(a) **(7 marks)**

Solve for x:

$$4^x = 8^{2x+2}$$

### Question 2(b) **(8 marks)**

Solve for x:

$$3^{x+1} = 5^x$$

### Question 2(c) **(8 marks)**

Solve for x:

$$\log x = 2\log 5 + 3\log 2 - (\log 4 + \log 5)$$

### Question 2(d) **(7 marks)**

Solve for x:

$$\log_2 (3x - 7) = 3$$

## Question 3 (Total 30 marks)

### Question 3(a)

Convert the following to decimal: [You must show workings]

1. $472_8$ **(4 marks)**
2. $3DB_{16}$ **(4 marks)**

### Question 3(b)

Convert the following to binary: [You must show workings]

1. $215.75_{10}$ **(4 marks)**
2. $9F.B_{16}$ **(4 marks)**

### Question 3(c)

Convert the following to hexadecimal: [You must show workings]

1. $1101\ 0110\ 1010_2$ **(4 marks)**
2. $439_{10}$ **(4 marks)**

### Question 3(d) **(6 marks)**

Perform the following additions:

$$1\ 1101_2 + 1\ 1011_2$$  

## Question 4 (Total 30 marks)

### Question 4(a) **(10 marks)**

Express the following in symbolic form. [You do **not** need a truth table].

*If today is Saturday, then lectures will take place. If lectures do not take place, then I will go swimming. I go swimming. Therefore today is Saturday.*

### Question 4(b) **(6 marks)**

Write down the inverse, converse, and contrapositive of the following statement:

*If it isn’t raining today, then I am going to the beach.*

### Question 4(c) **(14 marks)**

Complete the truth table for the following expression and state if the proposition is a tautology, a contradiction, or neither.

$$(p \land \neg q) \to (p \lor \neg r)$$  
$$(p \cdot \overline{q}) \to (p + \overline{r})$$
